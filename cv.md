## About myself:

I am 41 years old, I work as a power plant service manager. I have been working in this position for 10 years. I do not agree with the approach of the leadership and government to the development of the enterprise and the country. Therefore, I want to radically change my work profile. I would like to work in a team, to know and understand the goals, to see the results of work, to constantly develop.
I like to go in for sports: running, mountain biking.
